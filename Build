#  Build and test midonet.
#
#  The purpose of this (probably incomplete) script is to verify any
#  dependencies on things not in this git repo, build the midonet
#  software, and run all of the "developer tests," i.e., those that
#  don't require any special external hardware or software setup.
#  Eventually, options should be added to do subsets of this work (e.g.,
#  build and run only some of the tests) and perhaps some support for
#  assisting in the QA tests as well.
#
#  This code has just as much "framework" as it needs, and the framework
#  (such as it is) should be extended as necessary to keep the code
#  clean.

Perhaps your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set incorrectly or, if
not set, you don't have the right version of Java in your path.

On Debian/Ubuntu systems, ensure that openjdk-7-jdk is installed and,
if you have other JREs installed, you've done
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64

Using a Mac? You're on your own. :-)
