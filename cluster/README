# MidoNet Cluster

This module contains the Midonet Controller that is charge of all control plane
functions.  It abstracts communication with storage systems and low level
devices.

## Running the Cluster Daemon locally

Simply execute the following command from the root directory of the clone:

    ./gradlew cluster:midonet-cluster:run -Pconf=`pwd`/cluster/midonet-cluster/conf/midonet-cluster.conf

The Cluster will try to write on /etc/midonet_host_id.properties.  If
this path is not writable you can either make it so, or override adding:

    -Dmidonet.host_id_filepath=/tmp/midonet_host_id.properties

to the gradlew command.
